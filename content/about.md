This is a personal wiki site intended as an exercise in public learning collected into one place, so that it can be explored and potentially used as a resource by others. In contrast to, say, Wikipedia, the information presented here provides no guarantee of being factually correct. It is a mixture of my own learnings and opinions on various topics which you are free to disagree with at your discretion. You are welcome to correct me on things that are objectively incorrect, e.g. code samples that don't work properly, but for other matters I intend to stick with whatever feels right to me at any given point in time.

Everything here should be considered a work-in-progress, much like everything in life, my understanding of different topics is likely to shift and change over time and I don't intend any of these to be taken as a final word.
