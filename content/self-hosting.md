Self-hosting refers to digital services that you can host on your own personal servers rather than relying on some software-as-a-service provider to host them for you. The server you use for hosting might be a physically-owned server or a virtualised one in, say, AWS, but the important thing is that you have full control over it which grants you a level of independence from other service providers.

I'm fairly new to the world of self-hosting but I am proudly hosting this wiki and my personal website on a Raspberry Pi at home, given the low traffic they receive. I wrote a [blog post about how I set that up](https://chrislewis.dev/posts/self-hosting-my-blog/).

Here's a list of some software that is suitable for self-hosting that I intend to add to over time:

- [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) - self-hostable git server with GitHub-esque features like Issues, Pull Requests etc
- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) - useful for setting up a personal VPN (I've used it to establish short-lived connections for geo-locked content)
- [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) - Dropbox-esque software for file sharing and synchronisation across devices
