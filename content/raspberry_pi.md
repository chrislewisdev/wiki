Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer (SBC) that originally released in 2012 and has received several revisions since with increasingly powerful hardware. Its main drawcard is that it is a very small computer that is still capable of running full Linux workloads, albeit with minimal CPU power.

I own two Raspberry Pis, one each of the original and second revisions. Some things I've used them for includes:

- Running a personal [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) server for file-sharing my university documents
- Running [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) for emulating retro games on my TV
- Running a web server for this very website!

They're pretty handy computers and are a good way to get an introduction to Linux usage if you're not familiar, since there are lots of guides for doing just about anything on a Raspberry Pi.

You can of course check out the official [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for more info if you like.
